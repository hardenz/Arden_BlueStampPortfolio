The CKK006-Master zip file contains everything used to construct the robot arm, including the code and instructions

The Freenove Hexapod Robot Kit zip file contains everything used to construct the hexapod, also including the code and instructions

The stl files are what I designed in onshape to 3d print

part studio 1 is the standoffs I used to mount my robot arm onto the hexapod

The two controller mount files are 2 parts to the controller I used to combine the controls of the robot arm and hexapod
